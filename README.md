# FoodSaver
Final Year Project: Mobile Application + IoT device 

Food waste is a huge problem at every level of the distribution chain, beginning with producers 
and ending with the consumer. In the UK, households are responsible for around 70% of all that 
waste. Always remembering the ingredients in the kitchen and planning the food needs, can 
be a tedious and time-consuming task, which is not feasible in busy modern lives. 

To approach this issue, the focus was on creating a system for the kitchen to make it easier for 
consumers to keep track of the foods, and their expiration dates, while also providing concrete 
solutions for what to do with that food. These include recipes based on the items close to an 
expiration date and a map to donate food to your neighbors instead of throwing it away.

The system created has two components: a mobile application and an IoT device with two cameras 
used for adding or removing items from your kitchen inventory. While the application is 
responsible for providing information to the users, the IoT device is allowing easy and convenient 
interaction with the database while in the kitchen, even without the need for your phone to be 
around.

The final product aims to allow users to manage their kitchen items and let them make more 
informed decisions about their consumption, while also providing several solutions for different 
situations a person might face.
